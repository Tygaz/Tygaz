Yeah, I was rolling, rolling, feeling so free,
In the night, under the moonlight, just me,
Cruising in a Lambo, shining so bright,
Speeding down the streets, feeling out of sight.
(Chorus)
I was rolling, rolling, yeah, that's right,
I was rolling, rolling in the night,
Feeling the thrill, the adrenaline's high,
I was rolling, rolling, reaching for the sky.
(Verse 2)
Windows down, wind blowing through my hair,
No worries, no cares, just feeling the flair,
Living in the moment, no looking back,
I was on a journey, on an unstoppable track.
(Chorus)
I was rolling, rolling, yeah, that's right,
I was rolling, rolling in the night,
Feeling the thrill, the adrenaline's high,
I was rolling, rolling, reaching for the sky.
(Bridge)
The city lights were shining, illuminating the way,
As I raced through the streets, no time to delay,
The engine roaring, music pumping in my ride,
I felt alive, with a rush I couldn't hide.
(Chorus)
I was rolling, rolling, yeah, that's right,
I was rolling, rolling in the night,
Feeling the thrill, the adrenaline's high,
I was rolling, rolling, reaching for the sky.
(Outro)
So, if you ever see me rolling by,
In a Lambo, under the moonlit sky,
Know that I'm chasing dreams, taking flight,
Rolling, rolling, in the night's embrace, I ignite.
